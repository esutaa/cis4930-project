This is the template for how rooms might be generated in-game. 
With the current display resolution of 800x600, the dimensions of each room are
as follows:
800/32 = 25 squares wide, and
600/32 = about 18 squares high. Probably want to figure out some way to use the
excess 24 pixels.
Note that I'm assuming that all of our sprites will be 32x32 pixels. This may
change in the future.

I will implement a parser for these rooms that will treat anything between the
two dollar sign tags as a block comment.

The key for these rooms is:
x: wall
.: floor
0: hole

This is completely arbitrary and I'm only assigning them right now so that I can
prototype the room generation process.
